Out of my way I'm a running high
Take a chance with me and a give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world unknown
'Cause I ain't lookin' for overflow

Oh, baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And there you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising falling like the sea
You're lookin' so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) to you
I wanna walk all over
You

Moanin' groanin' stirring it up
So gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be that night

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over
You

I'm gonna walk all over you
