Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me,
They long to be
Close to you.

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me,
They long to be
Close to you.

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true.
So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And star light in your eyes of blue.

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.
Just like me,
They long to be
Close to you.

Why? Close to you
Why? Close to you
Ha, close to you
Why? Close to you
