Well, I'm shakin' and I'm nervous all over
And I don't mind tellin' you why
I lost my breath to the hands of death
And baby gonna say goodbye
It's all over town, my baby's put me down
Well, my mind is blanked up and dizzy
And I think I'm a gonna cry
If I find it's true, she found somebody new
I guess I'll lay right down and die
It's all over town, you're gonna put me down
Oh baby, I'm beggin' you baby
Oh baby, please go slow
You know I love you darlin'
With all my heart and all of my soul
My temperature's up with a fever
And I don't know what to do
I'm just a-sittin' at home by the telephone
I'm just a-waitin' for a call from you
It's all over town, you're gonna put me down

Oh baby, I'm beggin' you baby
Oh baby, please go slow
You know I love you darlin'
With all my heart and all of my soul
My temperature's up with a fever
And I don't know what to do
I'm just a-sittin' at home by the telephone
I'm just a-waitin' for a call from you
It's all over town, you're gonna put me down
It's all over town, you're gonna put me down
It's all over town, you're gonna put me down
