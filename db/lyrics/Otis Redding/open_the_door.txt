I've been so wrong, so many times. Now you know what
I'm talkin' about. We've all been wrong a time in our life.
And we all make mistakes sometimes of leaving what's good for us.
I made that mistake, now I'm tryin' to get back to my baby.

This runnin' round, sure 'nough, is killin' me
Let me, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in

Look into my eyes
Can't you see I got to come on in
I ain't lyin', and I ain't smilin' 'bout it, baby
Open the door or I'm bustin' in
Because this runnin' around
Sure 'nough, sure 'nough, is killin' me

Let me in, it's killin' me, baby
I got ta come on in
Let me in, baby, please let me in

I got ta come on in, honey
Open the door
Open the door
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in
Mama, mama, got to come in
Open the door
I can't stand this cold
Let me in this house
I'm tired of this runnin' around
Tired of being, tired of being all alone
Standing out here and walkin' with, walkin' with [fade]
