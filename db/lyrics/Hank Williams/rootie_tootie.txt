Met my future wife today
And her name is Kathy Mae
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Sunday gal.

Feelin' dandy, doin' swell
My gal is the village bell
Hotsy-totsy (Rootie Tootie)
Super-duper (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Monday gal.

You should see the people stare
When we walk around the square
Bouncy-bouncy, (Rootie Tootie)
Upsy-daisy, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Tuesday gal.

I'm not jealous, no siree
Just as long as she's with me
Wicky-wacky, (Rootie Tootie)
Humpty-dumpty, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Wednesday gal.

She's got "purty" eyes of blue
And she thinks I'm "purty", too
Tootsie-wootsie, (Rootie Tootie)
Hunky-dory, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Thursday gal.

Gonna make that lady mine
When she signs that dotted line
Hinky-dinky, (Rootie Tootie)
Yipsy-doodle, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Friday gal.
