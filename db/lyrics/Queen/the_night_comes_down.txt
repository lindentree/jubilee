When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun break in
Lucy was high and so was I
Dazzling, holding the world inside

Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

Oh, oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh, oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside

Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it

Oh, oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh, oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again
