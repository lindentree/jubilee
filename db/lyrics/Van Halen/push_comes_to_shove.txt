Does it seem cold in here to you? 
What's there to do tonight, anything? 
Give me another cigarette 
Is there anything left in that bottle? 
Yeah-Give it here 
Some people live apart; 
They break your heart so damn easy 
And then one night in sunny victory 
She decides and you agree, she's leaving 
Will you ever be the same? 
Will you ever be the same? 
That's when push comes to shove 
I believe it was inevitable 
That's when push comes to shove 
Could this be the one that got away? 
I get the message 
Guess I knew it all along 
Says you're a stranger 
Here in paradise, you fool 
Seems like forty days and forty nights 
Since someone used my first name 
Including you 
Will you ever be the same? 
Is this the one that got away? 
Now I'm ahead of the game 
Driving me insane 
It's a small change 
Ooh, I'm just a pushover 
Over and over
