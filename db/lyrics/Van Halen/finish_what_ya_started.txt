If you wanna see other guys
Baby, I could let it slide
You wanna lover, you want a friend
Mama, I can be both of them
I got the tools to satisfy
Just walk away, if I fall shy at all

Come on baby, finish what you started
I'm incomplete
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
I need some sympathy

I like to look at the long run
I like to take each step, one by one
Right on time, you will arrive
By keepin' the dream alive
It's alive and it's kicking
Inside of me
So come on baby, please

Come on baby, finish what you started
Oh! I'm incomplete uh!
That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted
Ow! Come on and finish me!
