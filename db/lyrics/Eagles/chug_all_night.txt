You scare me a bit,
But that's all right
You know when I want you
Most every night

And I've been meaning to tell you, baby
that it makes no sense
Still I'm finally convinced

I believe we could chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove is right
You're so much woman
Believe we could chug all night

On the day that I die,
Well, I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
I'll be alive in a dream

You better listen to me, baby
'Cause you know that I'm hung on you
'Til I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do

I do believe we can chug all night
I do believe we can hug all night
The band is loose and the groove is right
You're so much woman
Believe we could chug all night

No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo
So long and dark and real

We're gonna do a little chugging
We're gonna do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman,
I believe we can chug all night

I said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woo! It's only midnight, baby
Come on and do it to me
