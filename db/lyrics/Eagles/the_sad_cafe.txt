Out in the shiny night, the rain
Was softly falling
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had
All been washed away

Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh, it seemed like a holy place
Protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the
Things we could not say
We thought we could change this world
With words like "love" and "freedom"
We were part of the lonely crowd
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true
Some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind
Inside the Sad Cafe

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by
And wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some
And lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly
If they ever change at all
No use in asking why
It just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby
Inside the Sad Cafe
Why don't you meet me at midnight, babe
Inside the Sad Cafe
