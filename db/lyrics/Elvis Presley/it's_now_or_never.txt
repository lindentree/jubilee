It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

It's now or never
My love won't wait

It's now or never
My love won't wait

It's now or never
My love won't wait
