Trapped up inside here, like lions in a cage
I've been a mark of injustice
Bound by these chains
Can't find a reason, I'm on my own
My destiny waits for a sign from me
I'm leaving alone

I'm out on my way now
It's been so many years
The chase is my lifeblood
I have no more fears

Fire, burns in my veins
Anger, shows on my face
Hatred, it poisons my soul
Look out, I'm about to explode

Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with the rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last

Armed and dangerous

Am I evil, or am I insane
The lion inside of me, is no longer tame
A blade in my left, a gun in my right
to beat you within, an inch of your life
