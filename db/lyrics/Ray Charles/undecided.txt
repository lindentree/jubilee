First you say you do
And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn
And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
