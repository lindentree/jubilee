Everybody is doin' a brand new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your A B C's
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby Jump up, jump back
Well, now, I think you've got the knack

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
