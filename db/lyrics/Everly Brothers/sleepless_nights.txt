Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who, is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart in two

Somehow through the days I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait within
Oh but then through sleepless nights I cry again

Why did you go? Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be, please let it be
Oh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me
