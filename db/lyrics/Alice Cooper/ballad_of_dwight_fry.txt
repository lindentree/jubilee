Mommy, where's daddy?
He's been gone for so long.
Do you think he'll ever come home?

I was gone for fourteen days
I coulda been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin' on the floor

I was gone for all those days
But I was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the danger zone

See my lonely life unfold
I see it everyday
See my only mind explode
Since I've gone away

I think I lost some weight there
And I-I'm sure I need some rest
Sleepin' don't come very easy
In a straight white vest

Should like to see that little children
She's only four years old... old
I'd give her back all of her playthings
Even even the ones I stole

See my lonely life unfold
I see it everyday
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone insane

I wanna get outta here
I wanna get outta here
I-I've gotta I've gotta get outta here
I-I gotta get out of here

I gotta get out of here
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get outta here

Ya gotta let me out of here
Let me outta here
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get outta here

See my lonely life unfold
I see it everyday
See my only mind explode
Blow up in my face

I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I-I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe

Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free

I didn't wanna be
I didn't wanna be
I didn't wanna be

See my lonely life unfold
(I didn't wanna be
Leave me alone
I didn't wanna be
Don't touch me)
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone insane
