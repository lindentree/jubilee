Oh Banana co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh banana co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah

Oh she said "No go"
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, banana co.
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah
Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah yeah
