It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to control you

Like the other little children
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin'
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

When you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire till the dawn

But it's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

When you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire till the dawn

But it's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know that I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you
