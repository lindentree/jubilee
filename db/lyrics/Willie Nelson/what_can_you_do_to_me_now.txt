What can you do to me now 
That you haven't done to me already 
You broke my pride and made me cry out loud 
What can you do to me now 

I'm seeing things that I never thought I'd see 
You've opened up the eyes inside of me 
How long have you been doing this to me 
I'm seeing sides of me that I can't believe 
Someway somehow I'll make a man of me 
I will build me back the way I used to be 
Much stronger now the second time around cause 
What can you do to me now 
What can you do to me now...
