Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel 
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine 
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real 
And you're someone else's love now you're not mine 
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new 
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine 
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed 
And that's why I'm lonely all the time 

[steel]

So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me 
And take all the love I thought was mine 
Someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time 
Crazy arms that reach to... 
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
