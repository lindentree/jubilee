Oh dear
What if everything they say is true?
Oh, oh dear
Then there won't be anything for me and you

Well
Even if we have to start all over again
What will be the point in being a fool again?
Even if, even if we have to start all over again
Oh, what will be, what will be, what will be
The point in being a fool again?

Oh oh oh... no no no...

I made a decision
Revised it again
I saw what it meant to both my parents and friends
And I couldn't do it if I had tried
I couldn't hide my feelings inside

I say that's not my way, that's not my way
That's not like me, that's not like me
That's not my way, that's not my way
That's not like me, that's not like me
I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it
Oh and I tried, I tried and I tried
I say that's not like me, that's not like me
That's not my way, that's not my way
I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it
I couldn't try, try try try
That's not my way, that's not my way
That ain't my way

If I feel it in my heart
Oh oh...
