Alone and lonesome, I'm sad and I'm blue
Just thinking of you and the love that we knew
How well I remember when I told you that day
I wanted my freedom, I was going away

Now that I'm free I'm lonesome and blue
I just can't forget all the love that we knew
I let someone's kisses lead my heart astray
I said I'd forget you that was easy to say

I'll always love you though we're far apart
I just can't hide these tears in my heart
So clearly in dream I can vision your face
In hurts me to know someone's taken my place

Now that I'm free I'm lonesome and blue
I just can't forget all the love that we knew
I let someone's kisses lead my heart astray
I said I'd forget you that was easy to say
