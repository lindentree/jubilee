Slippin' and a-slidin'
Peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told a long time ago.

Slippin' and a-slidin'
Peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told a long time ago.

Baby I've been told
Baby You've been bold
I won't be your fool no more.

Oh Big conniver
Nothin' but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive.

Oh Big conniver
Nothin' but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive.

Slippin' and a-slidin'
Peepin' and a-hidin' 
won't be your fool no more.

Slippin' and a-slidin'
Peepin' and a-hidin'

Oh Malinda
She's a solid sender
You know you better surrender

Oh Malinda
She's a solid sender
You know you better surrender

Slippin' and slidin'
Peepin' and hidin' 
won't be your fool no more.
