I'm goin' to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
I'm goin' to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They've got crazy women there and
I'm goin' down to get me some
Well, I might take a train, I might take a plane
But if I have to walk, I'm goin' just the same
I'm goin' to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They've got crazy women there and
I'm goin' down to get me some

Well bye, bye bye baby bye
Wooo so long, bye bye baby I'm gone
Well bye, bye bye baby bye

I'm a holl'rin' and screamin'
Baby please come home
Well, I'm a holl'rin' and screamin'
Don't you leave me all alone
Well, I'm a holl'rin' and I'm screamin'
Baby please come home

Well bye, bye bye baby bye
Wooo so long, bye bye baby I'm gone
Well bye, bye bye baby bye

Hey hey hey hey
I miss my baby, I don't mean maybe
I miss my baby, I don't mean maybe
I miss my baby, I don't mean maybe
I'll miss my baby until the day I die
