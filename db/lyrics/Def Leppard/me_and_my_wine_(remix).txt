Oh yeah 
C'mon 
Oh yeah 
Oh 
Well I'm down in the alley of sally 
And I'm feeling my way 
And it's four in the morning 
I don't have a lot I can say 

I know I'm looking for some satisfaction 
But there ain't much news 
Got some walking from a back reaction 
I'm hanging down and loose 

Oh me and the boys have been drinking 
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking 
All I can say is 
I'm doing fine with just me and my wine 

Now my brain and my body are runnin' on different rails 
And I died and just say hi what if all else fails 
Oh I woke up in a subway station 
Lying half dead on the floor 
I don't remember anything that happened the night before 

[Repeat Chorus]

Now listen 
My hair's a real mess 
I feel and look like a joke 
And there's a hole in my jeans 
I just went right of smokes 
You know I'd like to get to know you 
But I ain't got the time 
I'm tryin' harder and harder 
To make this damn thing right 
Just me and my wine 

Well just me and my wine 
You know that I'm doing fine 
Well just me and my wine 
Ow 
Thank you
