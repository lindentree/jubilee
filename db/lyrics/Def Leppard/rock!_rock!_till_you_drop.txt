Hold onto your hat, hold onto your heart 
Ready, get set to tear this place apart 
Don't need a ticket, only place in town 
That'll take you up to heaven and never bring you down 
Anything goes! Anything goes! 

Women to the left, Women to the right 
There to entertain and take you thru the night 
So grab a little heat and come along with me 
'Cause your mama don't mind what your mama don't see 
Anything goes! Anything goes! 

Rock! Rock! till you drop 
Rock! Rock! never stop 
Rock! Rock! till you drop 
I say Rock! Rock! to the top 

Ridin' into danger, laughin' all the way 
Fast, free and easy, livin' for today 
Gotta lip service, get it while you can 
Hot, sweat 'n' nervous love on demand 
Anything goes! Anything goes! 

Rock! Rock! Give it to me 
It's what I got goin' thru' me 
Don't ever stop do it to me 
Yeah, Rock! Rock! You really move me 

Hold on, hold on, hold tight 
We're gonna rock tonight 
Too loud man, too loud
