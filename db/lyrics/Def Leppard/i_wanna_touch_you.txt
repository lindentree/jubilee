I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue 
I wanna touch U - Yeah 

I get high on U 
I'm on fire over U 
And I can't let U go 
I can't let U go 

I got love on the rise 
And I burn like a fire 
Got my eye on the prize 
Got love in my sights 
And I can't let U go 
I can't let U go 

Give me no reasons 
Give me no rhymes 
Give me that feelin' 
All of the time 

I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue 
I wanna touch U - Yeah, baby, that is true 
I wanna touch U - Nobody else will do, no 
I wanna touch U - 'Cos a little too much 
Could never be enough, no 

I get wired on U 
And I thrill to your touch 
Yeah, I excite over U 
Can't stop this landslide of love 
And I can't let U go 
I can't let U go, oh 

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Bridge]

I wanna touch U - Till we're stuck like glue 
I wanna touch U - I wanna touch U, yeah 
I wanna touch U - Oh, till we get it right 
I wanna touch U - Yeah, make it last all night 
I wanna touch U - Baby U excite 
I wanna touch U - 'Cos a little too much 
Could never be enough, now
