Come on do the jerk (come on do the jerk)

Come on do the jerk (come on do the jerk)



Everybody now gather around

Get hip to the new sensation

There's a brand new dance coming to your town

And sweeping across the nation



Come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)

I said, come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)



Now snap your back like a bullwhip crack

Now jerk your hip, let your backbone slip



You've done the monkey, you've done the twist

And the mashed potatoes too

The swim and the fly have all gone by

There's a brand new dance for you



Come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)

I said, come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)



You've got to bob and weave

Come on bob and weave

And when you do

Let your neck snap too



Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's alright



Well now jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)

Come on jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)

Well now jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)

Well jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)



Well now jerk to the left and jerk to the right

Jerk all day and jerk all night

Jerk it hard and jerk it soft

Jerk your hands and arms right off



Come on do the jerk in the morning (come on do the jerk)

Come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)

Now snap your back like a bullwhip crack

Now jerk your hip, let your backbone slip



Yeah, come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk )

Everybody come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk )

Jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
