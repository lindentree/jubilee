Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm

It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new
It's very subtle, the Continental
Because it does what you want it to do

It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance

You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental

You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

[brief instrumental]

You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm

The Continental!
