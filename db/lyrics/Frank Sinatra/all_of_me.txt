All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you

Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them

Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Get along without you

You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not
Why not take all of me

All of me
Come on get all of me
Can't you see
I'm just a mess without you

Take my lips
I want to lose them
Get a piece of these arms
I'll never use them

Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Ever make it without you

You know you got the part
Used to be my heart
So why not
Why not take all of me
