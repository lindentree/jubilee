You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
'Cause you do something to me
That nobody else could do

You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You got the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
'Cause you do something to me
That nobody else can do
That no one else in the world can do
