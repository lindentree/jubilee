Every kiss, every hug seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me
Let me stay in your arms I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me

I used to think your love was something
That I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own

Oh, I can't break away I must have you everyday
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free
You're getting to be a habit with me

Oh, I can't break away I must have you everyday
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free
You're getting to be a habit with me
You're getting to be a habit with me
