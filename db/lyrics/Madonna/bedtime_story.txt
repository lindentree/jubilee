Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Let's
Let's
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious, honey

Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel

Traveling
I'm traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
I'm gonna relax
In the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness

And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again
