Walked up to my baby 
Walked right up to my baby 
Tell me what have I done wrong 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 

There something about you baby 
Something 'bout you baby 
That I just can't understand 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 
I phantom some other man 

Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time 
Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 
I am still a worry on your mind 

Walked up to my baby 
Walked right up to my baby 
Tell me what have I done wrong 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long
