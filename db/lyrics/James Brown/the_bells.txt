There are four black horses 
With eyes of flaming red 
Their rovers are tied with ribbing 
All around my baby's head 

The bells are ringing And their sail is going to sea 

Yes I know why they're ringing 
They ring on for me 
Oh yea 

I wish I could see my baby 
This can't happen to me 
No, ... 

Baby please forgive me 
I know I've caused you pain 
I'll place your tears with diamonds 
Just to see your face again 
[Repeat]

Ashes into ashes 
Dust to dust 
Ashes into ashes
