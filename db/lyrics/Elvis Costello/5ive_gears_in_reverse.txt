Five gears in reverse
For girls looking for the big lift
Somebody send out for the night nurse
Please don't stick me on the late shift
If you don't know by now
Nobody's gonna tell you
If you don't know by now
The shock will probably kill you

[Chorus:]
But if your patience is exhausted and you still cannot decide
You're sitting in the garage contemplating suicide
And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath
All of this acceleration is driving you to death

Five gears in reverse
You think I don't know what I'm doing
Another fashionable first
Like walking down the road to ruin
But if you're safe and sound
Don't let me interrupt you
And if you're gagged and bound
Well how can I corrupt you

[Chorus]
