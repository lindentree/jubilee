Drop dead legs, pretty smile, hurts my head, gets me wild. 
Dig that steam, giant butt, makes me scream, I get nuh-nuh-nothing but the shakes over you 
And nothing else could ever do. 

[Chorus:]
You know that you want it. 
I know what it is. 
You know that you want it, baby, 
When the night is through, will I still be loving you ? 
Dig those moves, vam-pire set me loose, get it higher. 
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop nice white teeth, Betty Boop. 
Set it cool real heavy. 
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready. 

[Chorus:]

[Guitar solo]
