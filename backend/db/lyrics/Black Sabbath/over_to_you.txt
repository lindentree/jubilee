Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison
You called a school
Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

Traveling endlessly, I'm searching my mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday you'll suffer
Then what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises
Over to you

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Tears full of sadness
Sealed in my cell
Whispering secrets
What do they tell?
Mad politicians
Can't tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you...
