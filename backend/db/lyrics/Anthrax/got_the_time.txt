Wake up, got another day to get
Through now, got another man to see
Gotta call him on the telephone AY-O
Gotta find a piece of paper
Sit down, got another letter to write
Think hard, gotta get a letter just right
Little ringin' on the telephone oh no,
Gotta write another letter

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want, Two, three, go!
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head

If I, tell ya what I'm doing today
Will you, shut up and get out of my way
Someone ask me what the time is, I don't know
Only know I gotta know now
No time, tryin' ta get a watch repaired
No time, never got a thing to wear
Little ringin' on the telephone
Oh no, hear a ringin' in my head now

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want, Two, three, go!
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want, Two, three, go!
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head
