Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin
And in no time.. (no time) I..
I plan to make this one here mine and that's for sure
Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home
But uh, there's something bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma what's it gonna be? She said
