Wanna tell you about the girl I love 
My she looks so fine 
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of 
Maybe someday she will be all mine 
I wanna tell her that I love her so 
I thrill with her every touch 
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love 

I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 

Sunday morning when we go down to church 
See the menfolk standin' in line 
Don't say they come to pray to the Lord,
Not when my little girl looks so fine
and in the evening when the sun is sinkin' low 
Everybody's with the one they love 
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around 
Lookin' for my street corner girl 

I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 

In the bars, with the men who play guitars 
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times 
My little lover does a midnight shift 
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do 
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way 
'Cause I got a worried mind 
Sharin' what I thought was mine 
Gonna leave her where the guitars play 

I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I got a little woman and she won't be true 

(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I said she won't be true, no
Yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, no

Ah!

(Hey hey what can I do) 

I said she won't be true 
Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on

(Hey hey, what can I say?) 
Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on

Hey hey, what can I do 
I got a woman, she won't be true 
Lord, hear what I say 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
