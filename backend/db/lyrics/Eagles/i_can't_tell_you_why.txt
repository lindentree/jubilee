Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people
Who lived through years in the dark?

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy
It just ain't right
(try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

No, no, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why, no
