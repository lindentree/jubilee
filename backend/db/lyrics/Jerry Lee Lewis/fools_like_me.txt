Everybody tells me love is blind maybe so but I refuse to see
Everybody tells me the things you do I don't care cause I'm a fool for you
It doesn't really matter what you are it only matters what you are to me
And if it's I'm not wise enough to see but with love be without fools like me

Maybe lovin' you that's not so smart and maybe bein' you break my heart
I really should've loved you but I'd knew and I keep stop cause I'm a fool for you
I only hope this kind of love is real cause I can't ever change the way I feel
And maybe maybe I'm not wise enough to see but with love be without fools like me
