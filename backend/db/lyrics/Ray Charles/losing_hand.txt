I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
Your ways keep changing like the shifting desert sand

While I was playing fair baby, you played a cheating game
While I was playing fair baby, you played a cheating game
I know you don't care, but I love you just the same

I thought I'd be your king baby, yes and you could be my queen
I thought I'd be your king baby, yes and you could be my queen
But you used me for your joker ´cause I thought you're deal was clean

The way you did me pretty baby, I declare I never understand
The way you did me pretty baby, I declare I never understand
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
