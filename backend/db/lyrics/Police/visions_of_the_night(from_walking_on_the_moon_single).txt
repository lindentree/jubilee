Gazed into the visions of the night
Seen the darkness fall
I've heard a mountain fall away from sight
Heard that thunder call

I have seen the beast I call myself
Creature of the night
I feel the creeping darkness close
That I need electric light

They say the meek shall inherit the earth
How long will you keep it?
They sow a harvest but what's it worth?
There's no one left to reap it

Gazed into the visions of the night
Seen the darkness fall
I've heard a mountain fall away from sight
Heard that thunder call

I have seen the beast I call myself
Creature of the night
I feel the creeping darkness close
That I need electric light

They say the meek shall inherit the earth
How long will you keep it?
They sow a harvest but what's it worth?
There's no one left to reap it

Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night

They say the meek shall inherit the earth
How long will you keep it?
They sow a harvest but what's it worth?
There's no one left to reap it

Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night
Gazed into the visions of the night

I have gazed into the visions of the night
I have gazed into the visions of the night
