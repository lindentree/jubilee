She can't help it, the girl can't help it
She can't help it, the girl can't help it

If she walks by, the men folks get engrossed
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she winks an eye, the bread slice turn to toast
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

If she got a lot of what they call the most
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
The girl can't help it, she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware, the girl can't help it
(The girl can't help it)

If she mesmerizes, every mother's son
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she's smiling, beefsteak become well done
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

She makes grandpa feel like twenty one
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
The girl can't help it, she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

And if I go to her on bended knees
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it
(I can't help it)

Because I'm hoping, obviously
That some day, the answer would be
The girl can't help it, she's in love with me
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

If she walks by, the men folks get engrossed
