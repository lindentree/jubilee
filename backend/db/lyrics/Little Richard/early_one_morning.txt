Early one morning
Just as the sun was rising
I heard a maid sing
In the valley below

O, don't deceive me
O, never leave me
How could you use
A poor maiden so?

Gay is the garland
And fresh are the roses
Ive culled from the garden
To place upon thy brow

O, don't deceive me
O, never leave me
How could you use
A poor maiden so?

Remember the vows
That you made to your Mary
Remember the bower
Where you vowed to be true

O, don't deceive me
O, never leave me
How could you use
A poor maiden so?

Thus sang the poor maiden
Her sorrows bewailling
Thus sang the poor maid
In the valley bellow

O, don't deceive me
O, never leave me
How could you use
A poor maiden so?
