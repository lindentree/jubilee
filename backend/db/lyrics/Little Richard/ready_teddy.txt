Ready, set, go man go,
I got a girl that I love so,

I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll.

Going to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie,
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye,

I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll.

All the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls,
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball,
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are going wild,
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style,

I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll.

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans,
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam,
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right,
Gonna rock 'n' roll to the early, early night,

I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready teddy,
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll.
