When you awake, the day takes a bow at your door,
When you awake, the sun shines like never before,
Cloud soaked with rain find it hard to explain to the earth below,
They can't let it rain for then it would stain a heavenly show, you make it so,
When you awake, you open the eyes of my heart,
When you awake, my day really gets its great start,
All the winds and the birds join the simple refrain of a rippling stream,
My world becomes a midsummer night's dream, when you awake.
