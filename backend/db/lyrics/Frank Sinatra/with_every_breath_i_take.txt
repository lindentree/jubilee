I think of you with every breath I take,
With every breeze that wanders by.
And your name is a song
I'll remember the long years through.

I breathe your name with every breath I take,
And every breath becomes a sigh.
Not a sigh of despair
But a sigh that I'll always care.

Even now as I walk through the garden
Seems that I hear love say:
"Some day, some way."

And when I sleep you keep my heart awake,
And when I wake from dreams divine
Every breath that I take
