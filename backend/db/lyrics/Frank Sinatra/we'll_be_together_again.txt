No tears, no fears,
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part,
We'll be together again
Your kiss, your smile,
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart,
We'll be together again
Times when I know you'll be lonesome,
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you,
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday, someway,
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not good-bye,
We'll be together again
