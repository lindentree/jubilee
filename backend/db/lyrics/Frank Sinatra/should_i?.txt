Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?
Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?
Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you
And swear by stars above you?

Should I confess I love you?
