I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble or I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money or spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame, honey, for what I do
I know that I can be beggar or I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
Depends on you
I can be very lonely when I'm out with a crowd
I can be humble or I can be proud
Depends on you

I can save a great deal of money or I can spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame, baby, for what I do
I can be beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you
