Lately, I find myself gazing at stars, hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove, and feeling like someone in love.
