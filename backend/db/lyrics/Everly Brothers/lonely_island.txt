I'm living on a lonely island
In a loveless ocean
Full of misery
I'll die here on my lonely island
Unless you give your sweet love back to me

I can't seem to take it
I'm blue as I can be
I'm blind to any other lovers charms
I know I can't make it
Without your love for me
I've got to have you back here in my arms

I'm living on a lonely island
In a loveless ocean
Full of misery
I'll die here on my lonely island
Unless you give your sweet love back to me
