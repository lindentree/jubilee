Love, love is strange (yeah, yeah)
Lots of people take it for game
Once you've got it, you never wanna quit (no, no)
After you've had it, you're in an awful fix
Love is strange, love is strange

[spoken:]
[Phil:] Hey Don?
[Don:] What Phil?
[Phil:] How would you call your baby home?
[Don:] Well, if I needed her real bad, I guess I would call her like this

[sung:] Baby, oh sweet baby, my sweet baby, please come home

[spoken: Phil] Yeah, that ought to bring her home, Don!

People don't understand (no, no)
They think love is money in the hand
Your sweet lovin' is better than a kiss (yeah, yeah)
When you love (leave?!) me, sweet kisses I miss
Love is strange, love is strange
