[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive

Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel

Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice

Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel

As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
