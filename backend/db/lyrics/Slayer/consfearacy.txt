[King]

[All Leads: King]

I need to redefine
All the things I hate today
Politics that fail
From a president derailed
I hate the shit economy
It might as well be sodomy
I know that in the end
I'm expected to pretend

But I can't relate
To your verbal idiocy
No one's in control
When the government's the enemy

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy

Actions of hostility
Breeds conformity
Annihilation will begin
Extermination from within

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy

I need to redefine
How I see the world today
Seems that all the war
Didn't even up the score
It's only mind pollution
There is no resolution
Still I know that in the end
I'm expected to pretend
That I can Think of myself
Blame it all on someone else
Half-hearted smile
While you look the other way
I can't relate
To your verbal idiocy
No one's in control
When the government's the enemy

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy
