Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive

Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
You know baby
We can have a lot of fun

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man

All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you, baby
In an hour's time

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man

I goin' back down
To Kansas to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John the conqueroo

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man

The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N... man
