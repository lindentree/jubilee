Hey, mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut
Hey, mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

Your daughter she's old enough to make up her own mind
She's got sense enough to know, yeah
Wether she wants to be mine
Keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut
Hey mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

I'm in love with your little girl
An' your little girl's in love with me
You know we're together now
An' oh how happy we could be if you'd
Keep your big mouth shut
Hey mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

You say I'm not good enough to be your daughter's man
But when trouble comes her way
I'll be right there to hold her hand
Hey mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

Your daughter, she knows what she wants
An' she's got what she knows about
The way that she loves me, ouch, jus'
Knocks me out
Keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

Hey mama, keep your big mouth shut
Keep your big mouth shut

Get our coat an' hat
Now go on home an' leave us alone
