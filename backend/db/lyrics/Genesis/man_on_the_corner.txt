See the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know,
But he waits everyday now.
He's just waiting for something to show.

And nobody knows him,
And nobody cares,
'Cos there's no hiding place,
There's no hiding place - for you.

Looking everywhere at no one,
He sees everything and nothing at all - oh.
When he shouts nobody listens,
Where he leads no one will go - oh.

He's a lonely man, there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know,
But he waits everyday now.
He's just waiting for something to show - oh.

Nobody knows him,
And nobody cares,
'Cos there's no hiding place,
There's no hiding place - for you and me.

Are we just like all the rest,
We're looking too hard for something he's got
Or moving too fast to rest.
But like a monkey on your back you need it.
But do you love it enough to leave it - ah.

Just like the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know - oh.
But he waits every day now.
He's just waiting for that something to show - oh.

Who's the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know.
But he's there every day now.
And he's just waiting for something to show - oh.

Who's the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know.
Oh but he waits every day now.
He's just waiting for that something to show.
