[Usher:]
Peace up! A-town down!

[Lil' Jon:]
Yeah, yeah! OK!

Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher!

[Lil' Jon:]
Lil' Jon!

[Usher:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

Let's go

[Usher:]
Up in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' V-I
Keep it down on the low key (low key)
'Cause you know how it feels
I saw shorty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill
OK

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow!
(Watch out! Oh! Watch out!)
She's saying, "Come get me! Come get me."
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go."
Let's go
When I told her I said

[Usher:]
Yeah (yeah), shorty got down low and said come and get me
Yeah (yeah), I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah), her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah), next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

[Usher:]
So she's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)
Let's go
And I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me

'Cause I don't know
If I take that chance just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know
Is the way she dance make shorty alright with me
The way she (get low!)
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance
And I'm like yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?
(Let's go, bring the beat back!)
And I said

[Usher:]
Yeah (yeah), shorty got down low and said come and get me
Yeah (yeah), I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah), her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah), next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming:

Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

[Lil' Jon:]
Hey, Luda!

[Ludacris:]
Watch out!
My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And roar! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady I'mma milk the cow

And forget about game, I'mma spit the truth, what
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes, then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol
(let's go!)

How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds

Me and Ush once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

[Usher:]
Yeah (yeah), shorty got down low and said come and get me
Yeah (yeah), I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah), her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah), next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming:

Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

[Ludacris:]
Take that rewind it back,
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go
Take that rewind it back,
Usher got the voice to make your booty go
Take that rewind it back,
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go
Take that rewind it back,
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go
