Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me
Don't you know that I love you
Let me show why I'm true blue
When I know our love is true
Don't keep your love from me
If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could I sway your love my way
Then I say tell me how
Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me

If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could I sway your love my way
Then I say tell me how
Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me
