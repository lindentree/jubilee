I passed a home the other day 
The yard was filled with kids at play 
And on the sidewalk of this home 
A little boy stood all alone 
His smiling face was sweet and kind 
But I could see the boy was blind 
He listened to the children play 
I bowed my head and there I prayed 
Dear Lord above why must this be 
And then these words came down to me 
After all you're just a man 
And it's not for you to understand 
It's not for you to reason why 
You too are blind without my eyes 
So question not what I command 
Cause it's not for you to understand 

[steel]

Now when I pray my prayer is one 
I pray his will not mine be done 
After all I'm just a man 
And it's not for me to understand
