I've been lost inside my head,
Echoes fall off me.
I took the prize last night for complicatedness
For saying things I didn't mean and don't believe.

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man,
Have I become the hollow man I see?

Mmmmmm I see...This echoing.

You have placed your trust in me.
I went upside-down.
I emptied out the room in thirty seconds flat,
I can't believe you held your ground.

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man,
Have I become the hollow man I see?

I'm overwhelmed, I'm on repeat,
I'm emptied out, I'm incomplete.
You trusted me, I want to show you
I don't want to be the hollow man.

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man,
Have I become the hollow man I see?
I see...
