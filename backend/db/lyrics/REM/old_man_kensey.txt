Old man Kensey wants to be a sign painter
First he's got to learn to read
He's gonna be a clown on TV
Flexes his elbow taut and free
(That's my folly) I believe
Drink up the lake, Kensey's awake
(If that's my folly) that's my mistake

Old man Kensey wants to be a goalie
First he's got to learn to count
He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount
Letters to be signed and dropped off
(That's my folly) Kensey's going far
John, Bill and Ed, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go 

Old man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher
First he's got to learn to stand
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band
Letters to be signed, ransom, greed
(If that's my folly) I believe
Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ed
(If that's my folly) that's my mistake

Kensey's awake, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go
Drink up the lake, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go
