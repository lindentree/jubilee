I believe, that there's something deep inside 
That shouldn't be from time to time. 
I sure found out, thought love was such a crime 
The more you care, the more you fall 
No need to worry, no need to turn away 
'Cause it don't matter, anyway 

(oohh oohh oohh) 
I miss you in a heartbeat 
(oohh oohh oohh) 
I miss you right away 
(oohh oohh oohh) 
I miss you in a heartbeat 
'cause it ain't love, if it don't feel that way 
oh no 

When we touch, I just lose my self control 
A sad sensation I can't hide 
To love is easy, it ain't easy to walk away 
I keep the faith and there's a reason why, yeah 
No need to worry, no need to turn away 
'Cause it don't matter, anyway 

[Repeat Chorus]

Now, I ain't big on promises, I'll be true to you 
'Cause I'd do 'bout anything, yeah 
for some one like, baby for you 

[Repeat Chorus]
