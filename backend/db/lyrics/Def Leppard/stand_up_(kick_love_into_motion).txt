I gotta know right now 
It's got to be this time 
I wanna show you how 
Gonna make you change your mind 
There's an empty chair at my table 
There's an empty look in your eyes 

I just happen to be a man 
And you happen to be a woman 
And we happen to be together 
Try to stop this thing comin' 

Stand up, kick love into motion 
Take a little love and shake it all around, 
Stand up, kick love into motion 
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground 

Down to the ground, baby c'mon 
Stand up for love 

I'm gonna play your game 
I wanna play with fire 
I want to breathe your air 
Baby, gonna take you there 
If you lay your cards on the table 
I'll lay my love on the line 
Till you're mine 

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus] 

You couldn't get it much better 
You never had it so good 
Stand up together 
And when you're ready to 
You're gonna get what you should 

Little by little 
Like a fine wine 
My love is like a motor 
Runnin' all the time 
Step by step 
Easy and slow 
On the stairway to heaven 
What a way to go 

[Repeat Chorus]

Stand up, kick love into motion 
Take me in your arms 
And show me what you found 
Stand up, kick love into motion 
My love is like a motor 
Runnin' all the time 
Stand up, yeah, kick love into motion 
I said step by step 
Go easy, go slow 
Stand up, yeah, 
Stand up, kick love into motion 
Yeah, on a stairway to heaven 
What a way to go, stand up
