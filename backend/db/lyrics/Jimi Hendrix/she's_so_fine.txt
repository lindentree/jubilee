She walks with a bell-clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time
Time...
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck

She's so fine
She's so very very fine

The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind
Mind...
Morning sign sounds just like a lock
All these signs are always a stock

She's so fine
She's so very very fine

When I veer I get so near
But so far far far away
Listen to me today

We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her her

Ah ah
She's so fine
Ah ah
