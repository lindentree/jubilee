Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
And if you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile, Sara?

Smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?
Oh, smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara?
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Keeping me crazy, crazy
Smile awhile
