[Nathan:]
Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all thru the night

[Shawn:]
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl your wish is my command
I submit to your demands
I will do anything, girl you need only ask

[Chorus:]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Till you tell me to

[Wanya:]
Girl relax, let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl are you ready, it's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes (Throw your clothes) on the floor (on the floor)

[Shawn:]
I'm gonna take my clothes off too
I made plans to be with you

[Wanya:]
Girl whatever you ask me, you know, I could do

[Chorus:]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Till you tell me to

[Wanya:]
Baby tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life

[Chorus:]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Till you tell me to

[Chorus:]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Till you tell me to
